    "# SQL Interview Questions  - Quiz\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "This quiz contains questions on topics you can expect to see in an interview pertaining to SQL and Relational Databases. Some of them are multiple choice, while some are short answer. For these short answer questions, double click on the Jupyter Notebook and type your answer below the line. \n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 1\n",
    "\n",
    "What are the 4 main datatypes in SQLite3? Can we use other common types from other kinds of SQL?\n",
    "____________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "The 4 main datatypes in SQLite3 are TEXT, INTEGER, REAL, BLOB\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 2\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between **Primary Keys** and **Foreign Keys**.\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "The Primary Keys of a table are those columns which are identified uniquely a row.\n",
    "The Foreign keys are not the Primary Keys of that particular table but for another table.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 3\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the different types of relationships entities can have in a SQL database. \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "One-to-one: each row of a table is linked to a single row of another table using a key column \n",
    "one-to-many: each row of a table is linked to one or more rows of another table using a key column\n",
    "many-to-many: one or more rows of a table is linked to one or more rows of another table using a key column\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 4\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the various types of JOINs possible with SQL. \n",
    "_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "FULL OUTER JOIN: select all records from Table A and Table B, regardless whether the join condition is met or not\n",
    "INNER JOIN: select all records from Table A and Table B where the join condition is met\n",
    "LEFT JOIN: select all records from Table A, along with records from Table B for which the join condition is met (if any)\n",
    "RIGHT JOIN: select all records from Table B, along with records from Table A for which the join condition is met (if any)\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 5\n",
    "\n",
    "Explain the relationship between Aggregate functions and GROUP BY statements.\n",
    "_____________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "GROUP BY clause is used to output a row accross a specified column value. It is used in conjunction with Aggregate functions to perform a quick calculation on values being returned fronm a SELECT query, in other words Aggregate functions are used to summarize values. \n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Question 6\n",
    "\n",
    "What role do Associative Entities play (JOIN Tables) in many-to-many JOINs?______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n",
    "Associate Entities are the tables that are used to log the associations between 2 separate entities in a many-to-many relationship.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "## Summary\n",
    "\n",
    "In this lesson, we practiced answering open-ended interview questions for SQL and Relational Databases. "
